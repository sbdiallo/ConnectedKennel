The project concerning the opening and closing of doors automatically. An automatic door control system includes a sensor 
for detecting a dog, a temperature readjustment and a readjustment of the lighting in a connected niche. Systems and methods 
are very common in the art of opening and closing doors to enter and exit buildings, facilities, etc. Automatic doors are
in retail stores, supermarkets and the like.

The project generally involves an automatic opening and closing of the door that allows a dog approaching the door to open 
automatically. This system is controlled by the Arduino microcontroller. The system includes a proximity sensor that
opens the door, an LED for light in the doghouse, etc.

To start making such a system, the following items and tools are needed ...
